# Political Party Rating
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create an algorithm which will predict a persons rating of both the Democratic and Republican party based on their demographics.

## Motivation
The reason behind creating such an algorithm is to aid candidates and their team in planning and budgeting:
1. Helps identify which communities should be targeted for ad placements
2. Supports tour planners in knowing which areas to include in a candidates tour
3. Allows for better budget allocations
4. A tool to estimate projections for the candidate.

## Data Source
The data used comes from [Civic Leads](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/civicleads/studies/37188/datadocumentation#)
